<h1> Python Projects </h1>

<pre>
  Welcome to my Python Projects repository! 
  This repository contains a collection of mini-projects developed while learning Python.
  Each project is designed to solve a specific problem. (or)
  Demonstrate the use of key Python features, libraries, and concepts.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<ol>
<li><b> Bagel: </b> The Bagel game is a simple number-guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret number. After each guess, the program gives hints based on how close the guess is to the actual number:
  <ul>
<li>"Pico": One digit is correct but in the wrong position.</li>
<li>"Fermi": One digit is correct and in the correct position.</li>
<li>"Bagels": No digits are correct.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p> The aim of this repository is to document my learning journey through Python and demonstrate practical implementations of core concepts, including:
<ul>
  <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
  <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
  <li>File Handling</li>
  <li>Exception Handling</li>
  <li>Web Scraping</li>
  <li>GUI Development</li>
  <li>API Integration</li>
  <li>Data Visualization</li>
</ul>
Each project is a standalone mini-application that can be executed independently.
